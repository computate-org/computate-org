    MILESTONE_TITLE: Setup Tasks
    COLUMN_NAME: Setup Tasks
    ISSUE_BODY: |

      ### Create a Github organization

      As the instructor of the course, setup a new Github organization with a unique name. You will need to sign into github and share the organization with all the instructors involved. 

      https://github.com/

      Click the [ + ] button in the top right corner, then "New Organization". Click [ Join for free ]. 

      * Give the Organization account name a unique name with dashes, not spaces. 
      * Provide a contact email of one of the instructors. 
      * This organization belongs to: My personal account

      Click [ Next ]. 

      Search for usernames to add to the organization here, then click [ Complete Setup ]. 

      Fill in the survey questions, then click [ Submit ]. 

      ### Fork the computate-org repository into the Github organization

      Visit: https://github.com/computate-org/computate-org

      Click the [ Fork ] button in the top right. 

      Select the Github organization you created earlier. 

      ### Rename the computate-org repository to a unique name for the organization

      To manage many courses over time, it will help to rename the repository for each organization to keep track of them over time. 

      Click the "Settings" tab on the forked repository and change the repository name to a unique name, then click [ Rename ]. 

      # Add admin users to the repository

      Click the "Settings" tab on the forked repository, select "Manage access", then click [ Invite teams or people ] and add the instructors as admins on the repository. 

      # Enable issues in the repository

      Click the "Settings" tab on the forked repository and check "Issues" so issues can be added to the repository. 

      ### Clone the computate-org repository

      On the "Code" tab of the forked repository, click the [ Code ] button, select the SSH URL and copy it to the clipboard. Then clone the repository to your computer in a new directory, where "???" is the unique organization or unique repository name. 

      ```bash
      sudo install -d -o $USER -g $USER /usr/local/src/???
      git clone git@github.com:???/???.git /usr/local/src/???
      cd /usr/local/src/???
      ```

      Setup the upstream repository to pull updates from the upstream repository. 

      ```bash
      git remote add upstream git@github.com:computate-org/computate-org.git
      git fetch upstream
      git merge upstream/master
      ```

      ### Create an Ansible hosts file for the instructor
      
      First create the directory for the instructor inventory. 

      ```bash
      install -d {{ GITHUB_REPO_PATH }}/inventories/instructor
      ```
      
      Create a hosts file for your development inventory. Add your hostname to each of the following host groups so that ansible can run each of these playbooks on your host. 
      
      ```bash
      echo "
      [computate_org]
      localhost
      " > {{ GITHUB_REPO_PATH }}/inventories/instructor/hosts
      ```

      ### Create an Ansible vault for the instructor secrets
      
      As an instructor, create and edit an encrypted ansible vault with the information about the team taking the course, organization, and repositories.
      
      ```bash
      install -d {{ GITHUB_REPO_PATH }}/inventories/instructor/host_vars/localhost/
      ansible-vault create {{ GITHUB_REPO_PATH }}/inventories/instructor/host_vars/localhost/vault
      ansible-vault edit {{ GITHUB_REPO_PATH }}/inventories/instructor/host_vars/localhost/vault
      ```
      
      The contents of the vault will contain the secrets needed to override any default values you want to change in defining the course.
      
      https://github.com/computate-org/computate-org/blob/master/roles/computate_org_github/defaults/main.yml

      Here is an example of the contents of the ansible vault for the course: 

      ```yaml
      {{ lookup('url', 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/computate-org/computate-org/master/roles/computate_org_github/defaults/main.yml', split_lines=false) }}
      ```

      Once your Ansible hosts and vault are configured, you can run the ansible-playbook to generate the Github project board, columns, milestones, issues and cards. 

      ```bash
      (cd /usr/local/src/??? && ansible-playbook instructor.yml -i inventories/instructor/hosts --vault-id @prompt)
      ```

      Now view the results in github in your organization!

    ISSUE_BODY: |
      The installation of the project for both development and production in containers is completely automated with Ansible.
      Begin by installing both the ansible and python3 packages.
      
      ```bash
      sudo yum install -y ansible python3 python3-pip
      sudo pip3 install psycopg2
      ```
      
      If psycopg2 does not install, run:
      
      ```bash
      sudo pip3 install psycopg2-binary
      ```
      
      ## Ansible on older operating systems.
      
      If you have an older operating system that does not yet support python3, you may struggle to deploy the application on OpenShift in the cloud. The OpenShift Ansible modules seem to require python3 as the system library, so I recommend updating your operating system to something more recent, for example CentOS8 or RHEL8.
      
      On older operating systems, to deploy the development applications you might want to configure ansible for python2.
      
      To deploy to OpenShift, you will want to configure ansible to point to python3.
      
      You might update your ansible configuration like this to make it work:
      
      ```
      sudo vim /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
      ```
      
      ```
      [defaults]
      interpreter_python=/usr/bin/python3
      ```
      
      Your dependencies might be different on an older operating system.
      
      ```bash
      sudo yum install -y ansible python python-pip
      sudo pip install psycopg2
      ```

      ## Setup ssh on your computer for ansible to connect

      For ansible to run commands, it needs to be able to ssh and run commands as sudo. For that, make sure the sshd service is started and enabled after a reboot. Also test an ssh connection to your hostname to make sure the host is accepted. 

      ```bash
      systemctl status sshd
      sudo systemctl start sshd
      sudo systemctl enable sshd
      systemctl status sshd
      ssh localhost
      exit
      ```

      
      ## Ansible training.
      
      For training on ansible and automation, I recommend the following Red Hat course.
      By completing the course and taking the exam, you can be a Red Hat Certified Specialist in Ansible Automation.

      ### Create an ansible vault for your OpenShift.
      
      As a team, create and edit an encrypted ansible vault with a password for the host secrets for your shared OpenShift inventory.
      
      ```bash
      install -d {{ ANSIBLE_REPO_PATH }}/inventories/openshift/host_vars/localhost/
      ansible-vault create {{ ANSIBLE_REPO_PATH }}/inventories/openshift/host_vars/localhost/vault
      ansible-vault edit {{ ANSIBLE_REPO_PATH }}/inventories/openshift/host_vars/localhost/vault

    ISSUE_BODY: |
      ### Create an ansible vault for your local development.
      
      Help each member of the team interested in local development to create and edit an encrypted ansible vault with a password for the host secrets for your development inventory.
      
      ```bash
      install -d {{ ANSIBLE_REPO_PATH }}/inventories/$USER-localhost/host_vars/localhost/
      ansible-vault create {{ ANSIBLE_REPO_PATH }}/inventories/$USER-localhost/host_vars/localhost/vault
      ansible-vault edit {{ ANSIBLE_REPO_PATH }}/inventories/$USER-localhost/host_vars/localhost/vault
      ```
      
      The contents of the vault will contain the secrets needed to override any default values you want to change in the app defaults defined here.
      
      https://github.com/computate/computate/blob/master/ansible/roles/{{ APP_NAME_ANSIBLE }}/defaults/main.yml
      
      There are descriptions for each of the fields.
      There are several sections of fields, including:
      
      - app system defaults
      - Ansible defaults
      - Zookeeper defaults
      - Solr defaults
      - PostgreSQL defaults
      - computate-medical global defaults
      - app US English defaults
      - SMTP defaults
      - OpenID Connect auth server defaults
      - SSL/TLS defaults

      Here is an example of the contents of the ansible vault for local development: 

      ```yaml
      {{ lookup('url', 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/computate/computate/master/ansible/roles/{{ APP_NAME_ANSIBLE }}/defaults/main.yml', split_lines=false) }}
      ```

      Look for values to override, especially those like this: "...".
